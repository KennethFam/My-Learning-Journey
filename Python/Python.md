# Python

## Background
- For these notes, I'm starting off at Part 5 of [MOOC's 2025 Python Course](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-5), since I have already completed Parts 1-4 of the [2024 version](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/) a while back but never took notes. I may revisit those parts later on to make the notes complete.

## Installation

### Python
- On Linux, Python3 is usually installed by default. If it is not, you can install it using the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3
    ```
    - Note that python without the 3 typically refers to Python 2 on Linux.

- On Windows, you can install Python on the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or by using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and running the command:
    ```
    choco install python
    ```

### pip
- pip is a Python package manager.

- On Linux, pip is not installed. You can install it by running:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

- On Windows, pip should already be installed with Python.

## Running Python 
- Make sure you are in the same directory as the Python file that you want to run.

- Let's say we have a file named `main.py` and want to run it. We can run it by using:
    - `python3 main.py` on Linux
    - `python main.py` on Windows.

## Installing libraries using pip. 
- Similar to running Python, Linux uses `pip3` while Windows uses `pip`.
- If you try to install a package, you may run into this error:
    ```
    error: externally-managed-environment

    × This environment is externally managed
    ╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
        python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
        install.
        
        If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
        create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
        Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
        sure you have python3-full installed.
        
        If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
        it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
        virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
        
        See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

    note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
    hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
    ```
    - The error gives you two solutions: `venv` (virtual environment) is for libraries you would use in your code using `import` and `pipx` is for command-line tools. - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75608323/how-do-i-solve-error-externally-managed-environment-every-time-i-use-pip-3)

## Virtual Environments
- My notes for virtual environments are based off of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y21OR1OPC9A).

- A virtual environment is a self-contained location that enables you to maintain separate and isolated environments for your Python projects.

- Virtual environments let you manage dependencies, versions, and packages without conflicts across different projects.

### Set-Up & Activation
- To create a virtual environment, go to your project directory and run the command for your respective operating system.
    - For Mac/Linux, run:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        ```
    - For Windows, run:
        ```bash
        python -m venv env
        ```
    - Note: `env` is simply the directory name. You can name it whatever you want.

- To activate your virtual environment, run the command for your respective operating system.
    - For Linux/Mac, run:
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
    - For Windows, run:
        ```
        env\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
        - If this does not work, try removing the `.bat` extension.
    - Note: If you named your environment something other than `env`, you'll have to swap `env` out of the path with the name that you assigned it.
    - If the activation is successful, you should see `(env) ` prefixed to the normal line of your terminal.

### Deactivation
- To deactivate your virtual environment, simple input `deactivate`.
    - If this worked, you should see that `(env) ` is no longer prefixed to the normal line of your terminal.

### Dependencies/Packages

#### Checking packages installed in virtual environment
- On Linux/Mac, run:
    ```bash
    pip3 list
    ```

- On Windows, run:
    ```bash
    pip list
    ```

- Note: Running this command outside of the environment will result in a list of packages installed globally.

#### Saving Dependencies
- You should not be committing your whole environment directory onto GitHub. It should be apart of your `.gitignore` in the format `env_dir_name/`.

- Instead, we save all of our dependencies into a `requirements.txt` file by running:
    - On Linux/Mac:
        ```
        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
    - The listed commands take the output of `pip freeze` (dependencies) and puts it into `requirements.txt`.

#### Downloading dependencies for a project
- If you downloaded a project off of GitHub or some other remote repository with a `requirements.txt` file, you can download the requirements by:
    1. Setting up a virtual enviroment and entering it
    2. Running:
        - For Linux:
            ```
            pip3 install -r requirements.txt
            ```
        - For Windows:
            ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```

## Language Syntax

### Built-In Functions
- `sum()` gets the sum of numeric values in an iterable.
- `len()` gets the legnth of an iterable.

### Lists
- Instantiated using `[]`. Example:
    ```python
    names = ["Marlyn", "Ruth", "Paul"]
    print(names) # ['Marlyn', 'Ruth', 'Paul']
    ```

- You can append to a list. Example:
    ```python
    names.append("David")
    print(names) # ['Marlyn', 'Ruth', 'Paul', 'David']
    ```

- You can get the length of a list using the `len()` function. Example:
    ```python
    print("Number of names on the list:", len(names)) # Number of names on the list: 4
    ```

- You can sort a list using the `sort()` method. Example:
    ```python
    names.sort()
    for name in names:
        print(name)
    """
    Names in alphabetical order:
    David
    Marlyn
    Paul
    Ruth
    """
    ```

- Lists can store many type of data. Example:
    ```python
    measurements = [-2.5, 1.1, 7.5, 14.6, 21.0, 19.2] # list of floats
    ```

- Items in a list can be lists themselves. Example:
    ```python
    my_list = [[5, 2, 3], [4, 1], [2, 2, 5, 1]]
    print(my_list) # [[5, 2, 3], [4, 1], [2, 2, 5, 1]]
    print(my_list[1]) # [4, 1]
    print(my_list[1][0]) # 4
    ```
    - A two-dimensional array, or a matrix, is also a natural application of a list within a list. For example, the following matrix
        ![alt text](images/3x3_matrix_ex.png)
        could be presented as a two-dimensional list in Python like so:
        ```python
        my_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6]]
        ```
        - Since a matrix is a list containing lists, the individual elements within the matrix can be accessed using consecutive square brackets. The first index refers to the row, and the second to the column. Indexing starts from zero, so for example `my_matrix[0][1]` refers to the second item on the first row. 
            ```python
            my_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6]]

            print(my_matrix[0][1]) # 2
            my_matrix[1][0] = 10
            print(my_matrix) # [[1, 2, 3], [10, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6]]
            ```
        - A matrix can be traversed using 2 nested for loops:
            ```python
            my_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

            for row in my_matrix:
                print("a new row")
                for element in row:
                    print(element)
            """
            a new row
            1
            2
            3
            a new row
            4
            5
            6
            a new row
            7
            8
            9
            """
            ```
            - Here's a visualization of the matrix:
                - ![alt text](images/matrix_visualization.png)
                    - The image above reveals that a 3 by 3 matrix technically consists of four lists. The first list represents the entire matrix. The three remaining lists are items in the first list, and represent the rows.
                    - In the image above the execution has progressed to the second row of the matrix, and this list is what the variable `row` currently refers to. The variable `element` contains the element the execution is currently at. The value stored in `element` is the middle item in the list, i.e. 5.

- Lists can contain items of different types. Example:
    ```python
    persons = [["Betty", 10, 1.37], ["Peter", 7, 1.25], ["Emily", 32, 1.64], ["Alan", 39, 1.78]]

    for person in persons:
        name = person[0]
        age = person[1]
        height = person[2]
        print(f"{name}: age {age} years, height {height} meters")
    """
    Betty: age 10 years, height 1.37 meters
    Peter: age 7 years, height 1.25 meters
    Emily: age 32 years, height 1.64 meters
    Alan: age 39 years, height 1.78 meters
    """
    ```
    - The for loop goes through the items in the outer list one by one. That is, each list containing information about a single person is, in turn, assigned to the variable `person`.

### Functions

#### Using global variables within functions
- We know it is possible to assign new variables within function definitions, but the function can also see variables assigned outside it, in the main function. Such variables are called `global variables`.
- Using global variables from within functions is usually a bad idea. Among other issues, doing so may cause bugs which are difficult to trace.
- Example:
    ```python
    def print_reversed(names: list):
        # using the global variable instead of the parameter by accident
        i = len(name_list) - 1
        while i >= 0:
            print(name_list[i])
            i -= 1

    # here the global variable is assigned
    name_list = ["Steve", "Jean", "Katherine", "Paul"]
    print_reversed(name_list)
    """
    Paul
    Katherine
    Jean
    Steve
    """
    print()
    print_reversed(["Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"])
    """
    Paul
    Katherine
    Jean
    Steve
    """
    ```

### Scope
- Example of Scrope bug:
    ```python
    def number_in_list(numbers: list, number: int):
        for number in numbers:
            if number == number:
                return True
        return False
    ```
    - This function seems to always return `True`. The reason is that the `for` loop overwrites the value stored in the parameter `number`. Thus the condition in the `if` statement is always true.
    - Renaming the parameter solves the problem:
        ```python
        def number_in_list(numbers: list, searched_number: int):
            for number in numbers:
                if number == searched_number:
                    return True
            return False
        ```
