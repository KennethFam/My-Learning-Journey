# WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)

## What is it?
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

## Installation
- [Follow this guide to install WSL2 on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- You can move your installation to another drive by following [these steps](https://dev.to/mefaba/installing-wsl-on-another-drive-in-windows-5c4a).

## WSL Set-Up
