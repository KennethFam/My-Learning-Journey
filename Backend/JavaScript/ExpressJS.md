# Express.js

## What is Express.js?
- An intentionally barebones and unopinionated backend framework; it allows us to do many things how we want, and to extend it with only the features we need.

## Installation
1. Open project directory and run this command to create a package.json:
    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```
2. Run this command to install express in the project directory.
    ```shell
    npm install express
    ```
- Note: This helps keep track of the version of Express.js used for your project. It is common practice to install a separate package for each project because each project may use a different version of a package.
